# ALPCA
This is meant to be a python client for the game [Adventure Land - The Code MMORPG](https://adventure.land). It's heavily inspired by and based on earthiverse's typescript-based [ALClient](https://github.com/earthiverse/ALClient).
Currently a major work in progress; but once finished, I plan to make it available through pip for simple installation and use.
