# PythonScript Socket.IO

This packages is simply meant to be a slight modification of Miguel Grinberg's [python-socketio](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio) package.
My custom modifications allow for multiple event listeners to be placed on a single event and also allow for the removal of specific listeners.
99.999% of the code is directly from Mr. Grinberg and therefore he deserves the recognition for it.
